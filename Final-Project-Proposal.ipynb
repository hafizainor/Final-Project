    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate change has been a stuff of debate for many years. As a Clean Energy graduate from Temasek Poly, I always wonder why am I being taught alternative ways to generate energy, yet, most countries are still generating energy the \"destructive\" ways - which some assume to be the cause of climate change as current energy generation emits greenhouse gases.\n",
    "\n",
    "I always thought to myself,\n",
    "\n",
    "* *is climate change not true?*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *is climate change just a sign of the earth aging and has nothing to do with greenhouse gases?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to take this opportunity to see how Data Science can be used to answer the above question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project proposal, I will be doing a project regarding Climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "My current Null hypothesis : **\"Greenhouse gases has nothing to do with climate change\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets I obtained are from this link:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature data:\n",

    "International greenhouse emission data:\n",

    "https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/international-greenhouse-gas-emissions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk / Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "* The countries listed in each datasets varies. As such, some contries will be missing.\n",
    "* Can't find the dictionary for each dataset. The greenhouse emission data has long column name which is hard to understand.\n"
